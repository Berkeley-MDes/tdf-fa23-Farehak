# Fareha Khan, Technology Design Foundation

### Welcome to my GitHub repository! 

![This is me](Me.jpeg)

Hi! my name is Fareha Khan. I am a Mechanical Engineer by profession and a Designer by heart. Currently, I am based in Dubai working as an Industrial Sustainability Engineer at Schneider Electric. I deeply care about ideas and products that make us feel more humane and connect us with our true selves. I am co-founder of Efert, a non-profit public toilet management system in Karachi, my hometown. In my free time, I love to chat with my grandparents, watch sports with my friends or watch movies with my mom.

I came across a video of James Dyson answering some really fun desing questions and I absolutely love his design thinking.

If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# Report 1 - Week of 08/31/2023 #
This week, I got introduced to grasshopper and explored some files to design and laser cut a phone stand. So what is Grasshopper? In short, Grasshopper is a visual programming language that runs with Rhinoceros 3D. 

## :bug: Getting Started...

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
