Hi! my name is Fareha Khan. I am a Mechanical Engineer by profession and a Designer by heart. Currently, I am based in Dubai working as an Industrial Sustainability Engineer at Schneider Electric. I deeply care about ideas and products that make us feel more humane and connect us with our true selves. I am co-founder of Efert, a non-profit public toilet management system in Karachi, my hometown. In my free time, I love to chat with my grandparents, watch sports with my friends or watch movies with my mom.

I came across a video of James Dyson answering some really fun desing questions and I absolutely love his design thinking.

# Report 1 - Week of 08/31/2023 #
This week, I got introduced to grasshopper and explored some files to design and laser cut a phone stand. So what is Grasshopper? In short, Grasshopper is a visual programming language that runs with Rhinoceros 3D. 

## :memo: Getting Started...

The first step I took to approach this project was to read a little bit about Grasshopper and try to get a sense of what this software is. I found some really helpful information on [Rhino's website](https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper/) It explains how Grasshopper allows a wide range of functions from environmental analysis to robotic control! In addition to that, I also watched Kyle's beginner videos about Rhino.

Second step for me was to get started with the Phone Stand files that was shared with us in class last week. When I first opened the file, it was a little difficult for me to locate the options and tools. I was successfully able to open the grasshopper file through Rhino, but my screen looked very different from TJ's Rhino screen during class. 
This is what my screen looked like, very blank and no Remote Control

I figured the problem was that my screen was missing the Remote Control Panel which would be used to manipulate the variables. Then after hovering over different tabs and tools, I figured out that the RCP (Remote control panel) was in Grasshopper's window under view!

## :swimmer: Progressing...

After being able to locate the Remote Control Panel, I tried to modify the parameters such as phone dimentions, student height and table dimentions. I noticed that my heigth is shorter than the height of the student in example, so I also tried to change the phone angle in such a way that it would cover me completely.

I also chose to product only 2D drawings as I wanted to work with laser cutting. After I was satisfied with the parameters, I saved changes and checked out the drawing for productions file. The drawings seemed to be what I expected them to be so I exported them to dxf file and went on for laser cutting.

The material I chose was plywood 1/4 inch board. I set the dxf file for the right document setup such as stroke line: 0.072 pt, RGB 255,0,0 for cut, and, and no fill. The laser cutting process was very satisfying to watch.

After all the parts were cut, I assembled them to construct the phone stand. The assembled peice looked alright in terms of the cut, shape and size.

However, I noticed that the parts were not fitting perfectly, and the phone stand was not exatly sturdy. I noticed that this was because of the cuts in the base being slightly  larger than the thickness of the material.

I also realized that this orientation only allowed the phone to be held in landscape which is not very convenient. 


## ðŸ“ˆ Getting There...

I realized that there are a lot of things interconnected in this project and it is easy to get confused. Therefore, I decided to make a flowchart of actions that would help me produce my next phone stand models. The flowchart looked a little bit like this: 

![flowchart](flowchart.jgp)

We start by going back to the Grasshopper and Rhino files to change the parameters. Once the parameters are decided, the drawing should be checked to see if it matches expectation. The next step would be to bake the drawing in grasshopper so it can be exported to dxf for laser cutting. Next, the dxf file should be prepared with the right document set up. The laser cutter safety precautions should be checked. The plywood then should be kept at the right place and with focus view it should be checked whether the drawings are within the scope. 



## ðŸ”® Final Thoughts...
