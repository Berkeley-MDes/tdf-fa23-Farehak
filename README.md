# Fareha Khan, Technology Design Foundation

### Welcome to my GitHub repository! 

![This is me](Me.jpeg)

Hi! my name is Fareha Khan. I am a Mechanical Engineer by profession and a Designer by heart. Currently, I am based in Dubai working as an Industrial Sustainability Engineer at Schneider Electric. I deeply care about ideas and products that make us feel more humane and connect us with our true selves. I am co-founder of Efert, a non-profit public toilet management system in Karachi, my hometown. In my free time, I love to chat with my grandparents, watch sports with my friends or watch movies with my mom.

I came across a video of James Dyson answering some really fun desing questions and I absolutely love his design thinking.

If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# Report 1 - Week of 08/31/2023 #
This week, I got introduced to grasshopper and explored some files to design and laser cut a phone stand. So what is Grasshopper? In short, Grasshopper is a visual programming language that runs with Rhinoceros 3D. 

## :memo: Getting Started...

The first step I took to approach this project was to read a little bit about Grasshopper and try to get a sense of what this software is. I found some really helpful information on [Rhino's website](https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper/) It explains how Grasshopper allows a wide range of functions from environmental analysis to robotic control! In addition to that, I also watched Kyle's beginner videos about Rhino.

Second step for me was to get started with the Phone Stand files that was shared with us in class last week. When I first opened the file, it was a little difficult for me to locate the options and tools. I was successfully able to open the grasshopper file through Rhino, but my screen looked very different from TJ's Rhino screen during class. 
This is what my screen looked like, very blank and no Remote Control ![No RCP](grasshopperscreen.jpeg)

I figured the problem was that my screen was missing the Remote Control Panel which would be used to manipulate the variables. Then after hovering over different tabs and tools, I figured out that the RCP (Remote control panel) was in Grasshopper's window under view!

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!
